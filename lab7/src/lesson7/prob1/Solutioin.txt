Part B:
the reason it returns False is because the "equals()" method is
not correctly overriden from the superclass Object. It should be
public boolean equals(Object o) instead of public boolean equals(Employee e).

Part C:
the solution here is incorrect because removeDuplicates relies on a hash map solution,
but the Employee class does not override the hashCode from Object class. This means that
even though 2 objects are considered equal, they have a different hash code value, which is incorrect.

Part D:
the solution changes the Employee field visited i.e. "tracker.get(e).setVisited(true);"
a class used for a key in a hashmap or hashset should be immutable otherwise a different hashcode will be output
after the setVisited method is called and will lead to unexpected errors.
